INSTALLATION
* Ubuntu Linux:
 - dependencies: apt-get install python-gtk2 python-glade2 python-crypto 
 - Download the package and extract it. It wil create a directory called pnote
 - cd pnote
 - Run it using command python pnote.py

* Other Linuxes - just install the gtk2 and glade binding for python and python-crypto
* Windows - Yeah

- It runs fine provided that you install these python extensions above. Below is the step by step guide which works and tested by me at least.

pnote installation on window

Follow this exactly steps by steps :-). It is Windowz anyway

ok basically need to copy libxm2.dll and rename it to libxml2-2.dll to c:\Python26. The bundle gtk above is a bit big, maybe use the sas version and extract libglade later
So the step is below:

. Install python 2.6 from www.python.org

. Install gtk runtime for window from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/

. Get iconv.dll somwhere and copy into gtk dir

. download libglade (tested version 2.6.4-1 from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/libglade/2.6/. This url has many other up-to-date win32 binaries! 

. Exact the libglade-2.0.0.dll and copy to gtk installation dir (c:\Program Files\gtk2-runtime or similar)

. Download libxml2 from 
 http://www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/libxml2-2.7.6.win32.zip  extract it , rename to libxml2-2.dll and copy it to gtk2 runtime dir like above.

. Download three pygtk installation files, pycairo, pygtk, pygobject from  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/. Click in the directory and select latest version. pygtk select the glade version.

. Install in order, pygobject, pycairo and pygtk

. Download pycrypto from http://www.voidspace.org.uk
/downloads/pycrypto-2.1.0.win32-py2.6.zip and install it

. Download pnote, extract and run pnote.py inside the dir

The whole thing is that user does not need to edit PATH manually, gtk runtime installer does it, and it is smaller
Only two thing, libglade and libxml need manually copied/renamed. Can write an installer to do it automatically

* TODO
- Integrate with ldap for email address lookup
- Sent/Put to Sent Folder after sending note as email
